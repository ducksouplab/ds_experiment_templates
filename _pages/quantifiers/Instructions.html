<h1>Instructions</h1>

<p> Hi, and welcome to this experiment. Thank you very much for your participation. </p>

<p> As you may know, we are capable to communicate accurate information with other individuals even if they are strangers. That is what we are studying in the current experiment: our ability to communicate accurate information to other individuals. </p>

<p> During this experiment you will interact with participants in pairs. Each interaction will last 1.30 minutes. For each interaction, each participant will have a role: Participants will either be "guessers" or "describers". The task is very simple. The describer will see an image on the screen with several items (e.g. 150 bananas, 300 mushrooms, etc.) on the image. The describer has to describe the number of items in that image to the guesser but ⚠️ without using any explcit numbers⚠️. At the end of the conversation, the guesser will be asked how many items of each category there were in the image. The aim of the experiment is that the guesser has to guess the exact amounth of items there were on each. For instance, the guesser will be asked "how many bananans were there?" How many mushrooms?. the guesser can ask as many questions as they want. Similraly, the describer can describe the image however they want but they CANNOT USE EXPLICIT NUMBERS (e.g. the describer cannot say there are 100 mushrooms). </p>
