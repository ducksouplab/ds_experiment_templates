<h1>Instructions</h1>

<p> Welcome to this experiment. Thank you very much for your participation. </p>

<p> As you may know, we meet new people very often. We meet strangers in parcs, bars, unversities, etc. This social skill is very powerful. That is what we are studying in the current experiment: our ability to make new friends and enjoy conversations with strangers. </p>

<p> During this experiment, you are going to meet other participants. Your task is very simple, just talk with the other person as if you were making a new friend. There will be four interactions in total. Each interaction lasts four minutes. We hope you will enjoy your interactions and maybe meet like-minded individuals. After each interaction you will answer a few questions about the conversations. Particularly, you will be able to indicate if you would like see the other person again. If both participants answer "yes" to this question, we will put you in contact with the other person by sharing your prolific-IDs. </p>
