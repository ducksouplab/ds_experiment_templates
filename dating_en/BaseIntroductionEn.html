  <p>Welcome to this experiment. This experiment is organized by Pablo Arias from the University of Glasgow. The experiments lasts about 15 minutes. This experiment investigates human social interactions and how conversations and ideas come about. In this study, you will participate in 4 video conference interactions. During the conversations we would like you to brainstorm about different topics, which will be explained before each interaction. After each interaction, you will be asked a few questions about the conversations. All your answers are anonymous. Furthermore, we would like to record the audio/video interactions you will have. These recordings  will remain completely confidential and will only be used for scientific purposes. Your participation in the study must be completely voluntary, and you have the option to withdraw from the study at any time. By continuing, you declare that you are of legal age to participate in this study, that you have read and fully understood the paragraphs above, and that you agree to participate in this study.</p>
